# Function Return Value
In this program, you will be using C++ programming constructs, such as functions.

## main.cpp
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer value. Your program will then display that integer back to the user.

Your program should include the following:
1. A function named `getInteger()` that requests an integer value from the user, and returns that value to the caller
   - This function takes no parameters, but returns an *integer*
     - *Parameters appear between the parentheses, so for this function there would be nothing there*
1. Your `main()` function will call `getInteger()` and will then display the value returned by that function
   - *Partial code for this is provided - you simply need to add the call to the function in the body of `main()`*

# Hints
1. Be sure and define the function prototype before `main()` calls it so that the compiler knows its name, return type, and parameter count and types
1. Be sure the return value from the function is being captured in `main()`

# Sample Output
Please note that items in **bold** are user input. These values will not be in your program. However, when your program executes and asks for a value, you will type those values into the *Terminal* window.

## Sample Output #1
<pre>
Enter an integer: <b>7</b>
Your number is 7
</pre>

# Grading Checklist
1. **TODO**
   - Did you complete all TODO statements in main.cpp?
1. **Comments**
   - Did you comment your code to explain what the code is doing?
1. **Style**
   - Does your code follow the coding standards?
     - *Be sure your code is properly indented*
     - *Be sure you put a space on either side of all operators* (e.g. `=` `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` `<<` `>>` `||` `&&` `<` `>` `==` `!=`, etc.)
1. **Variables**
   - Did you use variable names and data types appropriate for the purpose and usage of the variable?
1. **Compile**
   - Does your program compile?
     - *Be sure there are no errors or warnings when you run clang++*
1. **Output**
   - Does your program produce the same results as the Sample Output?
1. **GitHub**
   - Does the GitHub Website show your latest code updates?
